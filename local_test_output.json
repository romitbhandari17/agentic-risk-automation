Liability risk is moderate due to the capped liability and exclusions for certain claims, but the exclusion of gross negligence or willful misconduct could lead to significant issues. Termination risk is moderate because the convenience termination clause allows for a 60-day notice period, which is reasonable but not the shortest. Financial risk is moderate due to the interest on overdue payments, which is capped at a reasonable rate. Overall, the contract is balanced but has some areas that could pose significant risks if not managed properly."
